Stacked acrylic, handwired, monobody split, 12.75u, 40% keyboard

<img src="https://github.com/ElKinoflop/Barghest/blob/main/images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Vozvan Keyboard Photo">

Stacked acrylic keyboard case designed for handwiring with a <a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/products/pro-micro-5v?_pos=2&_sid=c64ff0323&_ss=r" target="_blank">Pro Micro footprint RP2040 controller</a>. 12.75u stabless layout monobody split. Inspired by Peej's <a href="https://github.com/peej/lumberjack-keyboard" target="_blank">Lumberjack</a>, SquashKB's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/squash_kb/?hl=en-gb">Lesovoz</a>  and Trashman's <a href="https://trashman.wiki/keyboards/v4n4g0n">V4N4G0N</a>. There are lots of options on what you could do with the central section. I just tried to arrange the wires in a neat way on the top part and added an encoder to the bottom part. Other ideas for the bottom section would be to add additional switches, push buttons, LEDs or an OLED display.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the files. If you have any questions just ask (Discord username elkinoflop) and if you make one then share a photo with me!

<h1>Case Manufacturing</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Designed to be cut from 3mm acrylic</li>
  <li>There are multiple options for the central component cover</li>
  <li>As a rough idea of cost <a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/" target="_blank">Mechboards.co.uk</a> was the best price I could find in the UK at around £80-£90 (inc VAT) for the case and plate. This will vary depending on what acrylic you choose</li>
</ul>

<h1>Bill of Materials</h1>
<ul>
  <li>One of each DXF file (except for the plate) cut from 3mm acrylic.</li>
  <li>Plate DXF file cut from 1.5mm plastc/metal/carbon. I got mine cut from white POM so the central parts could be used as an LED diffuser if desired</li>
  <li><a href="https://mechboards.co.uk/products/pro-micro-5v?_pos=2&_sid=c64ff0323&_ss=r" target="_blank">Pro Micro footprint RP2040 controller</a></li>
  <li>M2 Standoffs with a outside diameter of 3mm. Various lengths. <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/8H1HG6Y" target="_blank">Amazon Standoffs</a></li></li>
  <li>M2 Hex socket button head bolts. Various lengths. <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32969042589.html" target="_blank">AliExpress bolts</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08151V9TS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title" target="_blank">ElectroCookie PCB Prototype Board 3.8"x3.5"</a></li>
  <li>Optional - WS2812B LEDs. There's enough pins on the controller to add some RGB if you want</li>
  <li>Optional - Rotary Encoder (EC11). There's enough pins on the controller to add and encoder if you want</li>
  <li>Optional - 12*12*7.3mm tactile push button(s). These fit into the breadboard if you want some extra button(s) in the middle</li>
  <li>Optional - <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08RMQP6YP?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title" target="_blank">1.25mm Molex PicoBlade connectors and wire</a>. I used these to connect the matrix to the central section so they can easily be disconnected if required</li>
  <li>Wire! Solid core 22 AWG suggested</li>
  <li>46x MX Switches</li>
  <li>46x 1N4148 Diodes (plus any extras if you have buttons/encoders in the middle)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Firmware</h1>
I used <a href="https://pog.heaper.de/" target="_blank">POG</a>  to create <a href="https://github.com/KMKfw/kmk_firmware" target="_blank">KMK</a> firmware. POG makes creating firmware super simple but I might learn how to create QMK/VIAL firmware at some point!
I have included my firmware files (generated by POG). 

If you have wired up the matrix and connected it to the same controller pins as I have then you should be able to use my firmware. Install <a href="https://circuitpython.org/board/waveshare_rp2040_tiny/" target="_blank">Circuit Python</a> onto the controller first and then copy all the unzipped files from <a href="placeholder" target="_blank">'firmware PLACEHOLDER'</a> onto the drive.

<h1>Handwired Matrix</h1>
This is how I handwired the Matrix.

<h1>Case Assembly</h1>
If you find some of the standoffs tight to push through don't force them. Use a small round file if you need to slightly widen any holes. The small round file from Draper 'Soft Grip Needle File Set, 140mm (6 Piece) (83982)' is the perfect size.
